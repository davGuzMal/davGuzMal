<h1 align="center"> Hello, I am David Guzman</h1>

# Here a little bit about me

I am an Electronic Engineer with knowledge in software development and oriented to work as Full Stack Developer. I studied my engineering career during 5 years in Colombia, then I started to discover and learn a lot of interesting technologies in both hardware and software. At 2018 I had already finished my career and since there I have gotten some experience working in the technology field. My more recent course was the Full Stack Developer in Soy Henry which I completed in December

# What do I do?

Currently, I perform projects and look for new challenges that may improve my tech abilities. I believe that technology is the key to our growth as a 
society and I do all my best to contribute to that process of growing.

# What is my main goal?

I would like to keep learning every day about technology and so I'll be able to grow professionally. I am sure that I can learn whatsoever new subject related to software since I truly love it
